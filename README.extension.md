## Highlights

The extension is organized into three sections: **Observe**, **Measure**, and **Improve**.

### Observe

| Page | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Dashboard** | Practice scores with week-over-week and month-over-month trends, skill finder summary, daily activity chart with per-harness breakdown, and top workspace stats |
| **Timeline** | Gantt-style session timeline with per-day drill-down, session overlap detection, and a searchable list view |
| **Coding Moments** | Screenshot gallery from AI coding sessions with story reels, workspace filtering, and progressive image loading |

### Measure

| Page | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Output** | Two tabs -- **Code Output** (generated code volume by language and workspace) and **Token Usage** (model usage table with per-model token breakdown) *(Token Usage temporarily hidden)* |
| **Burndown** | Monthly token budget progress with projection *(temporarily disabled)* |
| **Patterns** | 7x24 activity heatmap and work-life balance signals |

### Improve

| **Anti-Patterns** | Five practice score cards (Prompt Quality, Session Hygiene, Code Review, Tool Mastery, Context Management) with detailed findings, severity ratings, concrete actions, and example prompts |
| **Skill Finder** | AI-powered analysis of repeated prompts to discover custom skill opportunities, plus matching community skills and agents from the open-source catalog |
| **Context Health** | Overall context score, agentic readiness checklist, per-harness context provision breakdown, workspace context map (treemap colored by instruction quality), and AI-powered context file review |
| **Rule Editor** | Create, edit, and live-test detection rules as markdown with form-based or raw-source editing and AI-assisted drafting |
| **Rule Playground** | Interactive REPL for the rule DSL with field browser, function catalog, and metric list |
| **Data Explorer** | Browse request and session fields, view distributions, and run ad-hoc filters |

### Level Up

| Page | What it shows |
| --- | --- |
| **Learning Center** | Personalized quizzes and code-comparison rounds generated from your actual usage |
| **Achievements** | XP-based progression with Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Diamond tiers |
| **Agentic SDLC** | Track how you use AI across the full software-development lifecycle |
| **Share** | Generate a shareable stat card |

## Supported Harnesses

| **GitHub Copilot CLI** | `~/.copilot/session-state/` and `~/.copilot/history-session-state/` |

### Chat

Type `@aicoach` in any VS Code chat panel for conversational access to all coaching data. Slash commands `/summary`, `/improve`, `/compare`, and `/flow` give quick access to common analyses. The participant orchestrates multiple backend tools automatically to answer complex questions.

## Getting Started

1. Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`).
2. Run **AI Engineer Coach: Open Dashboard**.
3. Use the sidebar to navigate pages. Filter by workspace or harness at the bottom.
4. Run **AI Engineer Coach: Reload Data** to re-parse after new sessions.
5. Type `@aicoach` in VS Code chat for conversational coaching.
