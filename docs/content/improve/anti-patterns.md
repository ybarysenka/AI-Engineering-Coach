# Anti-Patterns

The Anti-Patterns page is the core improvement engine of AI Engineer Coach. It runs a set of detection rules across your session data and produces scored findings with actionable recommendations.

## Rule Engine

Anti-pattern detection is powered by an editable rule engine. Every detector is a self-contained markdown file with YAML frontmatter and a `Detection Logic` block written in a small domain-specific language (DSL). AI Engineer Coach ships 45 built-in rules spanning prompt-quality, session-hygiene, code-review, tool-mastery, and context-management. You can:

- Edit a rule's thresholds, description, and detection logic directly from the [Rule Editor](/improve/rule-editor/).
- Write a brand-new rule in natural language and let the AI builder scaffold the markdown and DSL for you.
- Live-test any rule against your own data, including threshold sliders for quick tuning.
- Drill into a **rule coverage heatmap** showing how each rule triggered across your workspaces.

## Score Categories

Five practice categories are evaluated, each scored from 0 to 100:

### Prompt Quality

Measures how well you provide context to the AI. Representative rules:

- **Missing File Context** -- Requests that do not reference files with `#file` or have open editors
- **Lazy Prompting** -- Short, unspecific requests that produce generic responses
- **Caps Lock Rage** -- Requests written mostly in CAPS indicating frustration
- **Profanity / Hostile Language / Frustration Signals** -- Sentiment-based rules that highlight breakdowns in the human-AI loop

### Session Hygiene

Evaluates how you manage your coding sessions:

- **Mega Sessions / Abandoned Sessions / Session Drift** -- Flag sessions that run too long, stop abruptly, or drift across unrelated topics
- **Late-Night Coding / Weekend Overwork** -- Detect overwork patterns
- **Repeated Prompts** -- Surface near-duplicate prompts that suggest your context isn't landing

### Code Review

Assesses how carefully you handle AI-generated output:

- **Auto-Approve Terminal** -- Terminal commands being auto-executed without a devcontainer
- **Speed Accept / Copy-Paste Blindness** -- Accept-heavy patterns that suggest minimal review
- **YOLO Mode / No Devcontainer** -- Unsafe execution sandboxes

### Tool Mastery

Evaluates how broadly you use available features:

- **No Slash Commands / No Plan Mode / Agentic No Tools** -- Underused productivity features
- **Premium Waste / Model Overreliance** -- Using expensive models for simple questions
- **No Skills / No Custom Instructions** -- Gaps in your context-engineering setup

### Context Management

Evaluates how efficiently your sessions use the context window:

- **Context Window Saturation** -- Sessions where the context window is nearly full
- **Compaction Storms** -- Frequent auto-compactions indicating sessions that run too long
- **Runaway Growth** -- Context size growing steadily without resolution

## Findings

Each finding includes:

- **PROBLEM** -- A description of what was detected, with specific counts
- **ACTION** -- A concrete recommendation for how to fix it
- **Examples** -- Expandable section showing real examples from your sessions

## Trends

Week-over-week (WoW) and month-over-month (MoM) trend indicators appear on each score card, so you can see whether your practices are improving or regressing.
